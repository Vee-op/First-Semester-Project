            <img src="./Assets/img/My_Image.jpg" alt="An image of Agu Vincent" class="my-image"/>
            <p>    
                My name is Agu Vincent Chibuike. I am a Cloud Engineering student of AltSchoolafrica with <mark>Student ID: ALT/SOE/024/0291</mark>. 
                I hail from Enugwu-Ukwu in Njikoka L.G.A of Anambra state, but currently residing in Lagos, Nigeria.
                My foundational education began at Intellectual Giants Christian Secondary School, where I undoubtedly cultivated a strong foundationin core subjects and Christian values.
                I furthered my academic journey at the Federal University of Technology Owerri, graduating with a degree in Quantity Surveying. 
                Fuelled by optimism and a goal-oriented mindset, I have an unwavering passion for innovation and creative problem-solving.
                This drive, coupled with my previous academic experiences, positions me for success in my current program.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the age of 13, I began my formal foray into the world of technology by enrolling in a computer training program. 
                Despite being the youngest in the class, my outstanding performance in class projects resulted in a scholarship for a computer hardware engineering course.
                I delved into the complexities of a CPU, learning to assemble and activate a system from the ground up, sparkling a profound interest in technology. I absolutely find the Cloud interesting and I crave for indepth knowledge in this space.
                Outside of work I enjoy football and listening to good music. <i>"Game of Thrones"</i> will always be my favorite Tv series along with the likes of <i>"Breaking Bad"</i> and <i>"Ozarks".</i>

            <h2>Why I Enrolled at AltSchool Africa</h2>
            <p>My dedication to Cloud Computing recently led me to enroll in the AltSchool Africa Cloud Engineering Program. However, my decision was influenced by a number of factors:</p>   
            <ol>    
                <li>
                    <b>Program Offered:</b>
                    <p> 
                        The AltSchoolafrica learning program perfectly alligns with my goal and interest.
                        My interest is in Cloud technologies, thus making my enrollment into the Cloud course the perfect fit.
                        They also offer a variety of majors/specializations within the broader field of technology.
                        And at the end of the program, I get to have a Diploma certicate which will not only serve as an evidence of, 
                        completion but also help me in the further pursuit of higher learning. 
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Cost & Scholarships:</b>
                    <p> 
                        The cost of tuition, fees and other expenses is relatively lower compared to traditional universities and some other tech. schools within the same category.
                        The 30%, 70% tuition scholarships available to every student encouraged me to enroll here at AltSchoolafrica even though I was denied this offer.
                        Morever, the payment of tution can be evenly spread through a 12 month period using the suitable payment option/plan of choice. 
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Flexibility & Convenience:</b>
                    <p> 
                        Many tech programs can't accommodate working, schooling persons nor busy individuals. 
                        In AltSchool, the program is tailored in such a way to accommodate everyone, putting into consideration the convenience learning of everyone.
                        The program only offers online learning which everyone can participate from the comfort of their of homes.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Alumni Success:</b>
                    <p>
                        The existence of AltSchoolafrica Alumni is quite an additional advantage and has been proven to be useful. 
                        A strong alumni network can be beneficial for networking and job opportunities after graduation.
                        From my little investigations, I saw a lot of good testimonies from those who have sucessfully completed their program here.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Accreditation:</b>
                    <p> 
                        Accreditation ensures that the school meets certain standards of quality and education.
                        The AltSchoolafrica's reputation preceeds them and they are fast gaining popularity in the country.
                        With their recent acquisition of the ASIC Accreditation, I was in no doubt about joining the program.
